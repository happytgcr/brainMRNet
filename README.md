BrainMRNet
The BrainMRNet model is designed to classify brain MR images. The design codes of the model can be used for different data sets. This model derives its source code from the BreastNet architecture, which we have previously designed and published. BreastNet model source code link: https://github.com/Goodsea/BreastNet Thanks to Kutsal Baran ÖZKURT, Zafer CÖMERT and Burhan ERGEN for his contributions. All Rights Reserved. The codes of the study can be used by referring to the following article.
